      While the United States is the third largest country in the world by population, the United States far and away has the largest number of prisoners of any country.
      In 2020, <a href ="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html">a staggering 2.3 million people were incarcerated in the United States</a> or 638 residents of every 100,000. China, whose population is 4.35 times that of the United States <a href ="https://www.statista.com/topics/2253/crime-and-penitentiary-system-in-china/">had 1.7 million individuals incarcerated in 2020</a>. The fact that more people are arrested and incarcerated in the United States more than any other country is an issue in and of itself, however, what is more concerning is the recidivism rate once incarcerated individuals are released from custody.

    <a href ="https://bjs.ojp.gov/BJS_PUB/rpr24s0810yfup0818/Web%20content/508%20compliant%20PDFs">A September 2021 report</a> published by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Statistics studied the recidivism rate of prisoners who were released in 24 States in 2008. The study found that approximately 66% of prisoners, were rearrested within 3 years, and 82% were arrested within ten years. Of interest to note, was that the percentage of rearrests declined from a high of 43% in year one to 22% in year ten. <br>

   Aliza Silber, a pro se staff attorney at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York states “that this study presents sobering statistics. At one time, the goal of the prison system included rehabilitation of incarcerated individuals. However, today the United States prison system offers little in the way of rehabilitation and virtually no meaningful support once an incarcerated individual is released. It is, therefore, not surprising that the recidivism rate is so high.”
   <p>
     The Department of Justice study noted that that males were more likely than females to be rearrested within a year of their release at a rate of 44% to 34%. This gender divide continues but narrows by year ten with males rearrested at a rate of 82.7% and females 75.5%. Further, 90% of prisoners who were 24 years of age or younger at the time of their release were rearrested within 10 years.

      Larry Lawton knows firsthand about the lack of rehabilitation in the United States prison system. Lawton, once dubbed “America’s most notorious jewel robber,” served 11 years in some of America’s toughest prisons. Today, he is a published author, and the only former convict in the United States to be sworn in as an honorary police officer and to be recognized on the floor of the United States Congress for his work in helping young people with the Reality Check Program, an organization aimed at helping youth be the best that they can be by demonstrating what can happen if they choose the wrong path.
    </p>
    <p>
    Lawton sheds light on why it is so difficult for formerly incarcerated individuals to adapt to society upon release and he provides another perspective on the high recidivism rate. In his book, <a href ="https://www.realitycheckprogram.com/store/Gangster-Redemption-Book-p235275106">Gangster Redemption</a>, Lawton recalls the day that he was released from prison. Lawton had to take a bus from Yazoo County, Mississippi to Tampa, Florida—to a halfway house intended to transition former inmates from life in prison to life in the real world. At some point during the trip, the bus stopped at a gas station and Lawton was instructed to get something to eat. Lawton went into a Subway sandwich store, but when it was his turn to order, he froze. “I looked up, and there seemed like a thousand choices to make…I was getting panicky…I left the line, went to the back of the bus, and I sat in the back of the bus crying like a baby…I thought to myself, I can’t even order a sandwich.(pg. 259)” Later in the trip, Lawton called his cousin Cheryl, a life coach, on a payphone. Lawton told Cheryl about what happened at the gas station, and Cheryl told Larry that this was normal: “In prison you didn’t make a hundred choices in a day. A person on the street makes between 1,500 and 2,000 choices in a day. You’re like a newborn baby in this big body.(pg. 259)” While Cheryl was able to calm Lawton down, “sitting in the back of that bus, I wanted to get back to prison, I had a very bad feeling about being free… I wanted to be confined again because when you’re confined you feel safe,(pg. 260)” Lawton said.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the reasons that individuals end up back in prison is that social safety nets are lacking for many former convicts once they are released from custody. Many have a difficult time finding employment and housing with a criminal record, some have mental health issues, and many do not have families to offer support to them upon release. Garren Small, an attorney who worked for the Vera Institute of Justice, opines that “the best way to reduce recidivism is to offer programs in prison that teach the skills necessary to be a productive member of the community” Mr. Small further notes that “society needs to figure out what our real priorities are and how we treat the most vulnerable people.” The United States correctional system must rethink the current model. Until reforms are made in the prison system, including the goal of rehabilitating the individual and a move away from mass incarceration, recidivism rates will continue to be high.
